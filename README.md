## Temperature Converter Java Swing Application

This repository showcases a temperature converter project developed during my Java Development Internship at InfoAid Tech, focusing on Java Swing for creating a graphical user interface.

## Overview:
Within the scope of the internship, I successfully crafted a temperature converter Java Swing application. This project emphasizes Java Swing's capabilities in building a user-friendly graphical interface for temperature conversion.

## Task Accomplishments:
1. *Java Swing Development:* Leveraged Java Swing to design an intuitive and visually appealing GUI for temperature conversion.

2. *Temperature Conversion Logic:* Implemented robust logic for converting temperatures between Celsius, Fahrenheit, and Kelvin.

3. *User Interaction:* Designed an interactive GUI allowing users to input temperatures and view the converted results.

4. *Responsive Design:* Ensured the application is responsive and provides an optimal user experience.

## Project Structure:
The project is organized as follows:

1. TemperatureConverter.java: The main Java file containing the Swing-based GUI and temperature conversion logic.

2. README.md: This file, offering an overview and description of the temperature converter project.

## Technologies Used:
- *Java Swing:* Employed for creating the graphical user interface.

## Usage:
To use the temperature converter, run the application in a Java-supported environment. Input temperatures in the provided fields, and the converted results will be displayed on the GUI.

## Getting Started:
To get started with the Temperature Converter Java Swing application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/HariR1893/aidTech_TemperatureConvertor.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd InfoAidTech-TemperatureConverter

3. Compile and run the application:
   bash
   javac TemperatureConverter.java
   java TemperatureConverter
   

4. Use the GUI to input temperatures and witness real-time conversions.

Feel free to explore and enhance this project further. It's a valuable experience gained during my Java Development Internship at InfoAid Tech, showcasing proficiency in Java Swing for GUI applications!
